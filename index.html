		<h1>OpenGLBook.com Temporarily Out of Order</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>2014-05-19:</strong> Oops. It looks like my host, GoDaddy,
			seems to have cancelled the VPS hosting account that the site was
			hosted on without informing me after more than 3 years of it being
			active on auto-renew. In the meantime, you can use
			<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140104122808/http://openglbook.com/">The Web Archive</a>
			to view the remnants of the site while I'm working on putting it
			on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> as an open
			source project (more on this later).
		</p>
		<p>
			I apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause you.<br />
