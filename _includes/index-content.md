**OpenGLBook.com** is a free OpenGL programming tutorial in online book format.
Click on [The Book]({{ site.url }}/the-book.html) to start learning OpenGL 4.0.
Several chapters contain OpenGL 3.3 compatible code samples in a sub-directory
named "compatibility" in the source code listing, if you only have access to
OpenGL 3 / DirectX 10 level hardware.

**New Chapters** are released periodically as they are completed and announced
on [the blog]({{ site.url }}/blog/).If you wish to keep informed, subscribe to
the blog's [RSS feed]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml) with your favorite RSS reader.

**Before you start** make sure that you
[read the preface]({{ site.url }}/chapter-0-preface-what-is-opengl.html)
to get a decent understanding of the evolution of computer graphics and where
OpenGL came from. The preface also lists the hardware, software, and knowledge
requirements for the book, so *don't skip it!*
