	Over the course of the last few months, I have received numerous emails and bug reports from people trying to compile the sample code as C++ code. So many, in fact, that I'm starting to think that the site may actually benefit from C++ code samples <em>instead</em> of C code samples.
</p>
<p>
	To get a good idea of the consensus of C++ vs C in this case, I've opened up a little poll. Please take a second or so to select an option from the list and vote, I'd really like to hear your opinion on this. Also, if you have a comment on this, please post it as well.
