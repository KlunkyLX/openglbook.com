	If you've been copying the code from the chapters, you may run into trouble when your program hits the <code>glGenVertexArrays</code> function in the form of an Access Violation/segfault.
</p>
<p>
	To fix this, add the following statement right above your call to <code>glewInit</code>:
</p>
<pre>glewExperimental = GL_TRUE;</pre>
<p>
	There seems to be some trouble with GLEW not entirely supporting the Core Profile out of the box, but the above fix should get you by for the time being.
