<p>
	I've updated <a href="{{site.url}}/chapter-2-vertices-and-shapes.html">Chapter 2</a> and made the following changes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Bug: Inclusion and explanation of Vertex Array Objects (VAOs).</li>
	<li>Content: A brief description of shaders and the included GLSL shaders.</li>
	<li>Content: Descriptions of the <code>CreateShaders</code> and <code>DestroyShaders</code> functions.</li>
	<li>Updated the inline source code as well as the source files to include these changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	My apologies to those who couldn't get the examples to run on their machines, let me know if you're running into any kind of trouble.
