<p>
	<a href="{{site.url}}/chapter-1-getting-started.html">Chapter 1</a> and <a href="{{site.url}}/chapter-2-vertices-and-shapes.html">Chapter 2</a> now include source code for OpenGL 3.3, as will future chapters before we move into OpenGL 4.0-only territory. Just scroll down the &quot;Conclusion&quot; sections on those pages and look for the files marked &quot;Compatibility.&quot;
