<p>
	In an effort to minimize the amount of bugs introduced, I am looking for someone to review the chapters and code before I release them into the wild.
</p>
<p>
	This person needs to be an experienced OpenGL programmer who's no stranger to modern OpenGL (3.0+) concepts and techniques.
</p>
<p>
	Let me know if you're interested or if you have any questions by shooting me an email at: <a href="mailto:eddyluten@gmail.com">eddyluten@gmail.com</a>
