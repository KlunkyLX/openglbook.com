	It's been a little while since the last update, but work on Chapter 4 is finally reaching a conclusion. In this chapter, we'll make our first steps into the third dimension and introduce a bit of required mathematics.

<p>
	If you haven't read the previous chapters yet, I <em>highly</em> recommend you doing so before continuing with this chapter since you'll need to understand all of the previous concepts.

<p>Keep an eye out for this chapter in the near future!</p>
