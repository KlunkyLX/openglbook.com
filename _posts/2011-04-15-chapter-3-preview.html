	Chapter 3 is a relatively short chapter on the use of Index Buffer Objects. I'm currently in the process of rewriting pieces of it to smoothen the transition between <a href="{{site.url}}/chapter-2-vertices-and-shapes.html">&quot;Chapter 2: Vertices and Shapes&quot;</a> and Chapter 4, a future chapter on a topic yet to be revealed.
</p>
<p>
	If you haven't read Chapter 2 yet, <a href="{{site.url}}/chapter-2-vertices-and-shapes.html">read it now</a> since you'll need knowledge of Vertex Buffer Objects for upcoming chapters.
</p>
<p>
	Keep on the lookout for this chapter in the near future.
