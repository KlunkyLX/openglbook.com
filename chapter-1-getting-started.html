<p>Now that you have a significant amount of background information under your
belt, it’s time to get your hands dirty with some actual code.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create an OpenGL context with FreeGLUT</li>
<li>Initialize GLEW</li>
<li>Create the boilerplate code used throughout the book</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="/chapter-0-preface-what-is-opengl.html">Check the requirements before continuing</a></strong></p>

<div class="Attention">
  <strong>OpenGL 3.x / DirectX 10 Level Hardware</strong>
  <p>
    This chapter is 100% compatible with OpenGL 3.x level hardware by changing
    only a few lines of code.
  </p>
</div>

<h1>First Steps</h1>

<p>Before we get started, make sure that you have the libraries discussed in the
preface ready for use in your compiler. The examples in this chapter (or in
this entire book for that matter) will not work without them.</p>

<p>Moreover, if you are using Windows, set your program to compile as a
console/command line program since we will write to the console for debugging
and informational purposes, even in this first chapter.</p>

<p>An OpenGL context allows us to pass commands to the underlying hardware, so
without one your OpenGL program is quite useless. This section will set up the
first bit of code that you will need to set up a functioning window; don’t
worry if you don’t understand what the code does at this point, we will discuss
the code in detail after we have our first program up and running.</p>

<p>Since we are starting from scratch, create a new file called <code>chapter.1.c</code>, open
it in a text editor or your development environment and insert the following
lines:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/11129276.js"> </script>

<p>Now that you have defined the first program, you may safely compile and run the
source code. What you see should be similar to the screenshot below:</p>

<p><img
  src="/images/4262_01_01.png"
  alt="Resulting Output"
  title="Resulting Output"
  class="center"
/></p>

<h2>Step-By-Step</h2>

<p>Even if the end result of the code above is an unspectacular blank window that
doesn&#39;t seem to do much, there is much going on behind the scenes. Let&#39;s step
through some of the code that we&#39;ve just added. We&#39;ll walk through the code
from the top of the code file to the bottom, leaving and returning to functions
where necessary.</p>

<p>The <code>WINDOW_TITLE_PREFIX</code> pre-processor definition simply serves as a
placeholder for our window title. The reason it&#39;s called prefix is because
we&#39;ll be appending some dynamic text to it a little later on in this chapter.</p>

<p>Next up are some global variable definitions <code>CurrentWidth</code>, <code>CurrentHeight</code> of
type integer, which store the current dimensions of the window. We also define
the global variable <code>WindowHandle</code>, used to store the handle to the window
created by FreeGLUT.</p>

<h2>Initializing</h2>

<p>After declaring the function prototypes and defining the <code>main</code> application
entry function, the next function of interest is the <code>InitWindow</code> function,
called by the <code>Initialize</code> function.</p>

<p><code>InitWindow</code> calls several FreeGLUT functions to create a window, starting off
with <code>glutInit</code>, which initializes the FreeGLUT library. This function does not
return anything, but simply sets up FreeGLUT for use in your application. In
any program, this should be the first FreeGLUT function you should call.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, <code>glutInit</code> takes two arguments, which are the command
line arguments from the main function. FreeGLUT takes several parameters, none
of which we shall use in this book, but for demonstrative purposes, we&#39;ll
simply pass the command line parameters to <code>glutInit</code>. If you don’t wish the
user to have any type of control of your program, you should pass empty values
to this function.</p>

<h2>Context Types and Window Options</h2>

<p>The next three function calls go together as they declare to FreeGLUT what type
of OpenGL context we&#39;d like to use for our program. The functions in question
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>glutInitContextVersion</code></li>
<li><code>glutInitContextFlags</code></li>
<li><code>glutInitContextProfile</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The parameters should be easily decipherable if you’ve read the section on
deprecation in the preface; we&#39;re asking FreeGLUT to return a
<strong>forward-compatible</strong> OpenGL 4.0 <strong>core-profile</strong> context.</p>

<p>The next function, <code>glutSetOption</code>, is called with the
<code>GLUT_ACTION_ON_WINDOW_CLOSE</code> option to make sure that the <code>glutMainLoop</code>
function in <code>main</code> returns to the program and doesn&#39;t exit the program when
it&#39;s done. The original GLUT library did not return to the program and after
GLUT was done rendering it would end your program. This meant that if you had
allocated any memory, there was no way to avoid memory leaks without some nasty
hacking into the GLUT library. FreeGLUT effectively ends this behaviour by
setting the <code>GLUT_ACTION_ON_WINDOW_CLOSE</code> option to
<code>GLUT_ACTION_GLUTMAINLOOP_RETURNS</code>.</p>

<p><code>glutInitWindowSize</code> specifies the initial size of the rendering window, in our
case the values stored in the <code>CurrentHeight</code> and <code>CurrentWidth</code> variables, 800
and 600 respectively.</p>

<h2>Display Modes</h2>

<p><code>glutInitDisplayMode</code> is a function that is a bit more involved since it
defines what type of OpenGL context we would like and how the device should
render our scene. In this sample, three distinct options are passed to the
function, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>GLUT_DEPTH</code></li>
<li><code>GLUT_DOUBLE</code></li>
<li><code>GLUT_RGBA</code></li>
</ul>

<p><code>GLUT_DEPTH</code> enables the usage of the <strong>depth buffer</strong>, an important mechanism
in 3D computer graphics. The depth buffer (also called Z-buffer) contains the
floating point Z-depth information of each pixel rendered to the screen. This
mechanism is important in the rendering of new objects for making sure that
they don&#39;t overlap any objects that are closer to the screen (thus also for
determining if the new pixel should overwrite the existing pixel). We&#39;ll
explore the depth buffer much more in chapter three where we&#39;ll start drawing
three-dimensional objects.</p>

<p><code>GLUT_DOUBLE</code> is a flag that enables the usage of <strong>double-buffering</strong>, which
is a feature that reduces image flickering. With double buffering, all of the
draw commands are executed on an off-screen buffer, which is sent to the screen
when all of the drawing for a frame has been completed so that no incomplete
images are displayed.</p>

<p>The buffer that’s currently displayed is referred to as the front buffer, and
the buffer that we&#39;re drawing to is called the (you guessed it) back buffer.
When all of the draw commands have been completed, these buffers are swapped so
that the back buffer becomes the front buffer and vice versa.</p>

<p><code>GLUT_RGBA</code> is a flag that defines the way colours are composited by using
individual Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha values. <code>glutInitDisplayMode</code> can take
several other options, which we&#39;ll explore throughout the book.</p>

<h2>Window Creation</h2>

<p>After the display options have been set, we&#39;re finally ready to create our
window, and thereby our rendering context. A call to <code>glutCreateWindow</code> will
create our context and will return a handle to our newly created window. As you
may have noticed, the sole parameter to this function is <code>WINDOW_TITLE_PREFIX</code>,
which will set the initial title for the window, in our case the string
&quot;Chapter 1.&quot; We immediately check the return value when the function returns
and make sure that if the value is less than one, the program displays an error
message and exits with the proper return value. A FreeGLUT window is not valid
if the window-handle&#39;s value is less than the number 1, at which point the
program should fail or retry to create the window.</p>

<h2>Function Call-Backs</h2>

<p>If the program got past this point, we have a valid context and we’re ready for
drawing. But before we do that, we need to tell FreeGLUT the functions used to
handle window resizing and rendering the scene, which we&#39;ll set with
<code>glutReshapeFunction</code> and <code>glutDisplayFunction</code>, respectively.</p>

<p>The reshape function is called each time the window is resized, and the display
function is called each time the scene is to be drawn to the screen. The call
back functions for this are defined below in detail in the <strong>Resizing</strong> and
<strong>Rendering</strong> sections.</p>

<h2>Debug Output</h2>

<p><code>InitWindow</code> is finished at this point and returns to the Initialize function.
Since we have an OpenGL context at this point, it&#39;s safe to call OpenGL
functions, and the first one we call is <code>glGetString</code> with <code>GL_VERSION</code> as its
parameter in order to retrieve the version of the OpenGL context created in the
<code>InitWindow</code> function. This string is passed to the command line with the
standard C function <code>fprintf</code>, which should display similar to the screen below.</p>

<p><img
  src="/images/4262_01_02.png"
  alt="Command Line Output"
  title="Command Line Output"
  class="center"
/></p>

<p>If the command line does not display OpenGL 4.0, something went wrong with your
context creation or your driver did not honour your request for an OpenGL 4.0
context. We&#39;ll use the command line throughout the book to display debug and
general information like this.</p>

<h2>Screen Clear Color</h2>

<p>The last function that we&#39;ll call in the <code>Initialize</code> function is
<code>glClearColor</code> with its four parameters set to <code>0.0f</code>, representing (in order)
the Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha color channels, this corresponds to the
FreeGLUT flag <code>GLUT_RGBA</code> that we used with the <code>glutInitDisplayMode</code> function.
The values provided to <code>glClearColor</code> must be on a scale from <code>0.0f</code> to <code>1.0f</code>,
corresponding to 0% - 100% color channel intensity.</p>

<p>The RGB color mode is the primary method used in displaying colors on many
electronic systems, and also in OpenGL. This system is very easy to use as it
closely resembles the way our eyes interpret light due to its additive
properties. What this means is that when two colour channels are mixed
together, another color is created, for example: when you overlap two equally
bright red and blue lights, the resulting light color is purple. This concept
is entirely the same for RGB colors, thus modification is very intuitive:</p>

<p><img
  src="/images/4262_01_03.png"
  alt="Additive Colors"
  title="Additive Colors"
  class="center"
/></p>

<div class="FYI">
  <strong>FYI: White and Black</strong>
  <p>
    In the RGB color space, when all of the color channels are at 100%
    intensity, the resulting color is white. This also means that the opposite
    is true: when all of the color channels are at 0% intensity, the resulting
    color is black.
  </p>
</div>

<p>The <code>glClearColor</code> function is used to define the color with which to clear the
back buffer each time a frame is prepared to be drawn to the screen. In our
case, the color is defined as black but can easily be modified to display any
color imaginable, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>glClearColor(<strong>1.0f</strong>, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);</code> for red</li>
<li><code>glClearColor(0.0f, <strong>1.0f</strong>, 0.0f, 0.0f);</code> for green</li>
<li><code>glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, <strong>1.0f</strong>, 0.0f);</code> for blue</li>
<li><code>glClearColor(<strong>1.0f</strong>, 0.0f, <strong>1.0f</strong>, 0.0f);</code> for purple</li>
<li><code>glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, <strong>0.5f</strong>, 0.0f);</code> for dark blue</li>
</ul>

<p>The last value, the <code>alpha channel</code>, determines the amount of transparency, but
since we don&#39;t use transparency in this chapter, setting this value is
meaningless for the moment.</p>

<h2>Main Loop</h2>

<p>At this point, we&#39;re done initializing and the <code>Initialize</code> function returns to
the <code>main</code> function where the program will call <code>glutMainLoop</code>, the heart of
the application. This function will run as long as the window is active and the
window hasn&#39;t been closed, issuing draw commands and handling window
operations. When the window closes, <code>glutMainLoop</code> terminates, and the <code>main</code>
function returns the standard return value of <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code>.</p>

<h2>Resizing</h2>

<p>There are two functions left that haven&#39;t been discussed in the previous
section, the first of which is called <code>ResizeFunction</code>, which handles the
window resize event. Each time the window is resized a new window size is
defined and passed to the application. We capture these new values in
<code>ResizeFunction</code> and store the values in <code>CurrentWidth</code> and <code>CurrentHeight</code>.</p>

<p>While this is all quite straightforward, the function call that stands out the
most is <code>glViewport</code>, something we haven&#39;t seen up to this point. A viewport
defines the area drawn to by OpenGL; any point that falls outside of the
viewport is not drawn. The reason this is called a viewport is because it is a
window into the scene, looking over only a small area of a possibly much larger
scene.</p>

<p><img
  src="/images/4262_01_04-300x225.png"
  alt="Viewport / Scene relationship"
  title="Viewport / Scene relationship"
  class="center"
/></p>

<p>It is important to notify OpenGL about any changes in the viewport so that we
don&#39;t draw any pixels outside of the screen, resulting in wasted calculations
that would be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>The <code>glViewport</code> function takes four parameters, namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>X-coordinate</li>
<li>Y-coordinate</li>
<li>Width</li>
<li>Height</li>
</ul>

<p>The X and Y coordinates correspond to the left lower bottom corner of the
viewport, in our case the left lower bottom corner of our window (0, 0). This
function also allows you to draw to a very specific area on the containing
window, smaller than the actual window itself. For example, this could prove
useful if you need to incorporate OpenGL graphics into a user interface.</p>

<h2>Rendering</h2>

<p>The final function we&#39;ll discuss in this section is <code>RenderFunction</code>, where the
drawing (rendering) of objects and the swapping of the back and front buffers
occur.</p>

<p>The first function call that we encounter in <code>RenderFunction</code> is <code>glClear</code>, an
OpenGL function call which cleans certain buffers specified through its
parameters. What this means is that before we reuse the buffer, all of the
pixels in it are set to a certain value. For example, the back buffer is
cleared with the RGB colour value specified through <code>glClearColor</code> earlier in
the Initialize function. The back buffer is cleared by passing
<code>GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT</code> to <code>glClear</code>.</p>

<p>Besides the back buffer, we also clear the depth buffer by passing the
<code>GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT</code> flag into <code>glClear</code>.</p>

<p>After clearing the buffers, we&#39;re free to draw whatever we like onto the
screen. However, in this example we don&#39;t actually draw anything but an empty
screen. This will change in subsequent chapters where we will actually start
drawing objects, and all of this drawing will happen after the <code>glClearColor</code>
line in <code>RenderFunction</code>.</p>

<div class="FYI">
  <strong>FYI: Drawing or Rendering?</strong>
  <p>
    Throughout the text you will encounter the words "drawing" and "rendering,"
    in our case they both mean the same thing: displaying something onto the
    screen.
  </p>
</div>

<p>The next function that we encounter is <code>glutSwapBuffers</code>, which flips the front
and back buffers. At this line, your changes will be displayed to the screen
and any new drawing will occur on what was previously the front buffer.</p>

<p>In the following image, buffer B is used as the front buffer for displaying
purposes, and buffer A is used as the back buffer for drawing purposes:</p>

<p><img
  src="/images/4262_01_05.png"
  alt="Before the swap"
  title="Before the swap"
  class="center"
/></p>

<p>After the call to <code>glutSwapBuffers</code>, the buffers are swapped and buffer B is
now the front buffer and buffer A is now the back buffer:</p>

<p><img
  src="/images/4262_01_06.png"
  alt="After the Swap"
  title="After the Swap"
  class="center"
/></p>

<p>After the buffers are swapped, the final function in <code>RenderFunction</code> is
called, namely <code>glutPostRedisplay</code>, which tells FreeGLUT that the application
is once again ready for rendering.</p>

<h1>Adding GLEW</h1>

<p>Now that we have an OpenGL 4.0 context, we&#39;ll need the tools to work with it,
and by that I mean the OpenGL 4.0 function calls that most likely don&#39;t come
standard with your system.</p>

<p>To get support for these OpenGL 4.0 functions, our program will need some help
from the GLEW library. To achieve this, the only thing we need to do is to
update the <code>Initialize</code> function to look like the code below:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/11130470.js"> </script>

<h2>Step-By-Step</h2>

<p>With only a single function call, we have access to all of the functionality
that OpenGL 4.0 provides.</p>

<p>We already had the pre-processor include directive <code>#include &lt;GL/glew.h&gt;</code> to get
access to all of GLEW’s function calls. If you browse through the <code>glew.h</code>
file, you may notice that it replaces the normally used <code>gl.h</code> file. This is
why we won&#39;t explicitly use the <code>gl.h</code> file provided by your compiler until a
future chapter where we will set up a rendering context from scratch.</p>

<p>Next, we initialize GLEW in the <code>Initialize</code> function. If you look at the order
in which the functions are executed, you&#39;ll notice that the OpenGL context is
created in <code>InitWindow</code> before GLEW is initialized with a call to <code>glewInit</code>.
This happens because GLEW needs to probe the OpenGL implementation for the
function calls that it includes, which means that an active context is
required.</p>

<p>After the call to <code>glewInit</code>, we compare if the return value from <code>glewInit</code>
equals <code>GLEW_OK</code>, if it does not, we write an error message to the command line
and exit the program. The error message will contain the actual error returned
by GLEW through the <code>glewGetErrorString</code> function call.</p>

<p>Visually, your program hasn&#39;t changed, so when you run it, the screen should
look exactly the same as the resulting screen from the previous section.</p>

<h1>Measuring Performance</h1>

<p>An important factor in most 3D computer graphics is performance and measuring
how well your program performs. By performance we mean the amount of data that
your program can process during a certain amount of time.</p>

<p>Performance in real-time 3D graphics is commonly measured with the amount of
renderings a program can complete in the duration of one second; this
measurement is called FPS (Frames per Second). In this section, we&#39;ll add a
simple FPS counter to our program.</p>

<p>The first modification needed is an extra global variable named <code>FrameCount</code>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/11130638.js"> </script>

<p>Add the function declarations for <code>TimerFunction</code> and <code>IdleFunction</code> to our
function declaration section:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/11130666.js"> </script>

<p>In the <code>InitWindow</code> function definition, modify the last few lines to include
calls to <code>glutIdleFunc</code> and <code>glutTimerFunc</code>:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/11130696.js"> </script>

<p>Add the following line to <code>RenderFunction</code> as the very first line before the
call to the <code>glClear</code> function:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/11132858.js"> </script>

<p>Add the following function definitions below the <code>RenderFunction</code> definition:<br /></p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/11132892.js"> </script>

<p>When you run your program, it should now look like the image below:</p>

<p><img
  src="/images/4262_01_07.png"
  alt="Framerate shown in titlebar"
  title="Framerate shown in titlebar"
  class="center"
/></p>

<h2>Step-By-Step</h2>

<p>The first change that we made was adding a new global variable called
<code>FrameCount</code>. This variable will hold the count of the amount of frames that we
will render in a certain amount of time. The value contained in <code>FrameCount</code> is
incremented each time the <code>RenderFunction</code> function is called.</p>

<p>Next, we declared two new functions, <code>IdleFunction</code> and <code>TimerFunction</code>, which
we notified to FreeGLUT to have a certain meaning in <code>InitWindow</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>IdleFunction</code> function definition is only a single line which causes
FreeGLUT to redraw as soon as possible. <code>IdleFunction</code> is only run when the
program has no more work to do, a state we wish to avoid if our goal is
performance.</p>

<h2>Frames per Second Timer</h2>

<p>The <code>TimerFunction</code> function is a bit more involved, but not very hard to
comprehend. The last line we added to the <code>InitWindow</code> function caused a timed
function to be registered through a call to <code>glutTimerFunc</code>, which takes the
following three parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>The amount of milliseconds that should pass before the function is called</li>
<li>The function to call when the amount of milliseconds have passed</li>
<li>The value to pass to the function</li>
</ul>

<p>The first time that <code>glutTimerFunc</code> is called, the amount of milliseconds is
set to zero, causing the function to be called immediately, in our case this
function is <code>TimerFunction</code>.</p>

<p>The first line in <code>TimerFunction</code> checks if the value is not equal to zero, if
the value would be zero, we&#39;d know that this would be the first time the
function is run and to skip the following block of code. In this case, the code
would simply reset the value of <code>FrameCount</code> and register another call to
<code>TimerFunction</code> in 250 milliseconds -- a quarter of a second.</p>

<p>When <code>TimerFunction</code> is executed again, the check encounters the number one,
signifying that this is not the first time that the function is executed and
that we are ready to display the frame count. The frame count will be displayed
in the title bar of the window, together with the current window&#39;s dimensions
in the following format:</p>

<p><em>Chapter 1: n Frames Per Second @ Width x Height</em></p>

<p>The title of the window is changed by passing a simple character string to the
<code>glutSetWindowTitle</code> function. The frames per second are calculated by
multiplying the value contained in <code>FrameCount</code> by four since we execute this
function every &frac14; of a second. The width and height are obtained by
reading the value from the <code>CurrentWidth</code> and <code>CurrentHeight</code> global variables.</p>

<p>If you wish to update the title more often, you can set the <code>glutTimerFunction</code>
in the <code>TimerFunction</code> function to update more often. For instance, if you wish
to update the title eight times per second instead, change the millisecond
value to 125 and multiply the <code>FrameCount</code> by eight instead of four.</p>

<h2>Vertical Sync</h2>

<p>If you run your program and notice that the frames per second displayed don&#39;t
change, your program may automatically be bound to Vertical Sync (or V-Sync).
This value should be equal to the refresh rate of your monitor and is a feature
added by your display driver. Vertical Sync is another method for eliminating
flickering by waiting for the screen to finish drawing the current frame to the
screen before submitting the next one.</p>

<p>As mentioned, sometimes your driver will turn on V-Sync by default for some
programs. This incurs no difference in quality to the output of your program
since the frames processed per second is pegged to the maximum amount of frames
that your display device can process. This means that if your monitor runs at
60 Hz (refreshes the picture 60 times per second), a framerate of 100 frames
per second means that 40 frames are never displayed and is therefore
meaningless.</p>

<p>If you so desire, you can turn Vertical Sync <em>off</em> in your display driver’s
control panel under the <em>3D Settings</em> (or similar) heading to get a
reading of the potential frames per second processed by your program. However,
I do not recommend doing this since it will not enhance the performance of your
program in any way whatsoever.</p>

<div class="FYI">
  <strong>FYI: Frames per Second</strong>
  <p>
    Frames per Second, more commonly referred to as FPS is the amount of
    frames that were rendered by a program during the timespan of a second.
    This is a metric with limited use in determining the rendering frequency of
    a program. There is, however, another metric that may provide more useful
    in a production software where performance is critical, and this is
    milliseconds per frame. OpenGL provides functionality to retrieve the time
    it took for the hardware to render a frame through performance queries,
    which you can read about
    <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/timer_query.txt">here</a>.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>If you don&#39;t understand each function call yet, <strong>don&#39;t worry</strong> since you don&#39;t
have to memorize them all. As long as you have a decent understanding of the
mechanics that operate the program, you should be okay until we get to the
nitty-gritty stuff.</p>

<p>Now that we have a valid rendering context and our window is good to go, in the
<a href="/chapter-2-vertices-and-shapes.html">next chapter</a> we&#39;ll start
drawing some actual geometry to the screen and explore vertices and polygons.</p>
